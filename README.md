# My-Easy-Maths

My Easy Maths is a Java desktop Application that I developed during the summer holidays after my first year at university, and it does the following:

It solves quadratic equations
It solves simultaneous equations
It finds out the highest common factor and the lowest common multiple for given inputs
It solves solves triangles (calculates the angles and the length of the sides)
It has a basic calculator with an easy-to-use interface
It works out the angles and sides for any regular polygon
It finds out whether a number is prime, and if not, it shows all its dividers
It converts between all the different numbering systems used in computer systems (Bin, Dec, Hex, Oct)
It deals with Binomial Coefficients (Choose Numbers).
Working on this app has made me an independent learner and has helped me develop some problem-solving skills and some programming skills.
